1. Terraform- Fundamentals & Core Concepts
====================================
1) What is terraform ? 
Ans) 🌍 Terraform Overview
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp used to provision, manage, and version cloud infrastructure declaratively.

Supports multiple clouds (Azure, AWS, GCP, VMware, etc.) using providers.
Executes infra creation via a dependency graph and plans changes before applying.
Ensures reproducibility & consistency — same code = same infra every time.
In Practice: I use Terraform to manage multi-env infra (Dev, QA, Prod) from same codebase using workspaces and variables.
